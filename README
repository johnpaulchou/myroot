This builds libraries and objects that are useful in ROOT

To use, setup ROOT (or cmsenv or whatever) and run the Makefile.

You will also need to include the dynamic library that is created.  You can do this by modifying the rootlogon file to include the lines:

  gSystem->AddIncludePath("-I/MYDIR/myroot/include");
  gSystem->AddDynamicPath("/MYDIR/myroot/lib/");
  gSystem->Load("libmyroot.so");

where you must replace "MY_DIR" as appropriate.
